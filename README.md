All this is doing is exposing the price entered on the backend for the property. This backend price is not necessarily the price the property will sell for but rather what the agent/owner has decided they want the property to show up under when filtering by price.

Behind the scenes this extension makes several API calls using a binary search to narrow down the exact price of a property.
